FVWM95 Updated README
=====================

This is the FVWM95 sources and xclass applications and library forked
to work and compile on modern Linux distributions, along with added
features. I have included three root level directories:

  - fvwm95/             - the FVWM95 window manager source
  - xclass/             - the source for the xclass library
  - all-applications/   - the source for the xclass applications

Each individual directory contains its own readme and license, and 
all modifications to the projects are licensed to their respective
licenses.

My ultimate goal for this project is to create a Linux distribution
as close to the Windows 95 "classic" theme as possible. My goal is to
have something to fall back on once program developers finally pull the
plug on Windows XP/2003 compatibility.


GTK+ THEMES
===========

In the future, I wish to create a GTK2 and GTK3 theme to include by default,
it would do wonders for OS integration. Possibly a modification of "Redmond"
mapped closer to the Windows 95 style. Maybe even have the system colors
match up to the colors of the GTK themes.

I have a sample gtkrc for GTK+ 2.0 in gtk-themes/gtk-2/. This is pretty
close to what Windows would look like, except for some font and scrollbar
issues. Our main issue is GTK3, as many applications, most notably
Mozilla-based applications, are switching to GTK3. For GTK3, we may have
to include a full-fledged theme. 

I am considering working on a python-based system that can change the
GTK colors as well as the FVWM colors to create an integrated OS.
