FVWM95 Updated README
=====================

This is the FVWM95 sources and xclass applications and library updated
to work and compile on modern Linux distributions. I have included 
three root level directories:

  - fvwm95/             - the FVWM95 window manager source
  - xclass/             - the source for the xclass library
  - all-applications/   - the source for the xclass applications

Each individual directory contains its own readme and license, and 
all modifications to the projects are licensed to their respective
licenses.

My ultimate goal for this project is to create a Linux distribution
as close to the Windows 95 "classic" theme as possible. My goal is to
have something to fall back on once program developers finally pull the
plug on Windows XP/2003 compatibility.

In the future, I wish to create a GTK2 and GTK3 theme to include by default,
it would do wonders for OS integration. Possibly a modification of "Redmond"
mapped closer to the Windows 95 style. Maybe even have the system colors
match up to the colors of the GTK themes.
