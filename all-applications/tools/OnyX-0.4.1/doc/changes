Fixed the display on the explorer.
It no longer starts with all of the explorer items opend up.

Scrollbar in project explorer now maps more appropriately to
  the viewable/unviewable part of the project.

Added the item selected event to the OnyxTree object.
Added DisplayWidth and DisplayHeight to the OnyxTree object.
  This allows a determination of just how big the tree object will
   need to be to display the entire tree.
Added SizeToFit method to OnyxTree. This will automatically
  resize the tree object to display the entire tree.

Added a bell notification to the OnyxButton object. It will
  signal a bell on the appropriate xdisplay if both the
  button is disabled and if the event is disabled.

View grid on/off added. If you dont want to see the grid just turn it
 off. This also allows the backcolor or picture to show.

Fixed small problem with custom controls menu. In certain situations
 it could list controls twice. It will now auto update itself every time
 it is loaded.

Fixed problem with OnyxButton. Disabling it during a button click
 event would cause it to pop down later when reenabled if the mouse
 passed over it.

Creating a new project now also automatically selects certain OnyxObjects
 from the Custom Controls menu. Right now this is a static list of selections.
 Eventually it will be user definable.
