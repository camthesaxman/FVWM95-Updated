Much of the following information is about the OnyX screen shot. You can
get that right <A HREF="OnyXprev.0.3.0.gif">here</A>. It is a gif and approximately
134153 bytes. The size is about 800x600.</H3>
Here is a quick and dirty screen shot of OnyX. It was taken on an 800x600
screen. However, OnyX was originally developed on a 640x480 screen. So
those with smaller terminal, don't freak :) I know how ya feel. When I
get done it should still work on a 640x480. My color depth is also currently
at 16 bits. So if this picture looks funky on a lower depth screen then
try the following. Cross your eyes, stick one foot up behind your head,
place one or more cheeze puffs into your left nostril, put your fingers
in your ears, stick out your tongue, lick your nose, and shout "I wanna
work for Bill Gates!" Now you should look even sillier than the picture
and so upon returning to it, it wont look so bad after all. :)

<P>What you are seeing here several windows that OnyX uses. They do not
have to be visible all of the time, with the exclusion of the top one.
I use these for this demonstration. There are sever other less used windows
that are not shown here. (The Menu Editor for example.)

<P>This is a a picture development of a run program similar to the one
distributed with the Xclass.&nbsp; It is of course the window entitled
"Run...".&nbsp; It is not really running because it is being modified.
In other words, OnyX has full control over that window.

<P>Although you cannot see it, the mouse is on the check box in "Run...".
You should be able to see the small brackets on the corners. I was currently
resizeing/positioning that box. You can also see several other objects
in "Run...", They are, clockwise from the top left: an icon, a label, a
open/save file dialog control, a screen information control, a drop box,
three buttons, a check box,&nbsp; and another label.&nbsp; The screen information
control and open/save file control are displayed as icons since their look
is not modifiable. In fact, the screen information control is never displayed
in a running process. It&nbsp; just relays the attributes of the screen.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>To the right of the "Run..." window can be seen the "Project Explorer".&nbsp;
The RunWindow folder has been opened and the XtermCheckBox has been selected.
This matches what is being done in the development window. Indeed, the
development windows, the project explorer, and the properties window should
all stay in sync automatically. Scanning the list you should be able to
match the names with the objects in the "Run..." window.&nbsp; By now you
may have noticed the "Application" entry in the project explorer. This
is not a window but instead will eventually include properties to affect
the whole application. i.e.: author, version, company, etc. Underneath
RunWindow you can see RunConfiguration. This is a additional window in
the project that has its own objects attached to it.

<P>Above and to the right of the "Project Explorer" you can see the "Properties"
window. As you can see it is showing the properties of the check box in
"Run...".&nbsp; If you are concerned about the "Properties" window being
to thin, don't be. Resizeing the window will show more space to enter property
values.

<P>Below and to the right of the "Project Explorer" is the "Toolbar" window.&nbsp;
Just like its name suggests it is a toolbar. (Had to state that just in
case any Microshaft programmers happen to stumble on this page. And no,
I don't mean Visual Basic/C++/Java people. I mean those people who work
for Bill and made that operating system you are about to reboot because
it has a half life of 30 minutes. *grin*) You can see a few of the various
tools available. Right now the object selection tool/button is selected.
OnyX will have its core OnyX tools and it will allow for user created tools
as well. So if you don't like something, just build a better one and go
with it. Since the tools you use are distributed as a part of the final
program, there shouldn't be any conflicts.

<P>The tools shown in the toolbox are not the complete set. There are several
more available and the list is growing all of the time.&nbsp; The size
of the toolbox is not forced. You can resize the toolbox and it will automatically
adjust the buttons to fill it up in the most appropriate way possible.
Then, it will resize itself to trim off the extra space. I have it in the
rectangular shape for this demonstration so that the name would be visible.
Normally I prefer a 3xWhatever configuration.

<P>Behind those four windows is the OnyX make window. It is entitled "Makeing
Project". I did a quick build here so you can see that I am trying to keep
everything non command line based. In other words, no XTerms. While I like
XTerms, it just doesn't seem like a GUI to me if I am forced to use them.
Thus, the project build is completely viewed in the OnyX environment.
<BR>Side note: while eventually I hope/wish to have an OnyX code editor,
right now all I do is shell off to 'pico'. Alas, there is that durned XTerm
again. Ill get that taken care of eventually though. Of course, one of
the features have in OnyX is the selection of your own editor. So you can
use the OnyX internal editor, pico, or anything else. All you emacs fans
can cheer now. :)

<P>And finally, at the top of the screen, is the main "OnyX" window itself.
This is the only one that has to keep running during the whole process.
You can minimize/resize/move it of course. Just don't close/kill it. The
toolbar is being constantly extended as more functionality is added. The
purpose of the buttons, from left to right, is: Open Project, Save Object,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
New Window,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Make, Make and Run, Run Program,
Stop Program,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Show Code,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Lock Controls, Snap To Grid, Properties, Toolbox,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
and the Project Explorer.

<P>Well, that's a small walk through. Ill expand this a little more later.
