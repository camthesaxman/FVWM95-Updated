<P><A NAME="Changes"></A><B>July 30, 1997 (v0.1.0)</B>
<UL>
<LI>
Added Initial Text Property to OnyxTextBox. Allows it to first be displayed
with desired text.</LI>

<LI>
Added ApplicationPreload for any events that must take place before any
windows are created.</LI>
</UL>
<B>July 31, 1997 (v.0.1.1)</B>
<UL>
<LI>
Changed the new project window to go to file selection if enter is pressed
in the text box.</LI>

<LI>
Entered in the message box tool for general programing.</LI>

<LI>
Fixed a problem in saving that would cause an incredible amount of blank
lines to be written to the .cc file. All blank lines are now removed.</LI>

<LI>
Added the Class and Resource properties to the window tool.</LI>

<LI>
Now onyx uses .onyxrc in the home directory. If nonexistent it will be
created.</LI>

<LI>
Added options window. OnyxLocation and EditorCommand now user configurable.</LI>

<LI>
Modified OnyxTextButton control. It will now load a blank text button if
it is unable to load the picture for a picture button. Before it would
just segv. This failure can be detected with the Button->PictureFound variable.
It is set to False if this occurs. Although set to true if a text button
was desired, thus checking it wont hurt, it doesn't really make since and
so will always read true.</LI>

<LI>
Included onyxrun.oxp as first sample onyx project. (See README)</LI>
</UL>
<B>August 31, 1997 (v.0.1.2)</B>
<UL>
<LI>
Onyx now locates its own ObjectRepository.</LI>

<LI>
Fixed a segmentation fault when adding new tools. The problem was located
in OnyxButton.cc</LI>

<LI>
The OnyxTextBox cursor is back!!! :) I had forgotten to add FocusChange
to the wanted events.</LI>

<LI>
The crazy multi-selections seen in the properties box are gone.</LI>

<LI>
Makefiles should now work with Bash 2.0+</LI>

<LI>
Window moves and resizes now detected during development. It no longer
needs to be done by hand in the properties window.</LI>

<LI>
OnyxMsgBox Create() function is now a dummy function. Show() will implicitly
create and then show the message box.</LI>
</UL>
<B>September 5, 1997 (v.0.1.3)</B>
<UL>
<LI>
Project Explorer now uses a tree view to display the project. This is from
a new control OnyxTree which comes directly from the OXListTree class found
with the explorer.</LI>

<LI>
Selecting an item in object explorer now selects the correct property list
in the properties window and the correct object if the window is being
display. Likewise, selecting the object on the window will select the appropriate
object in the project explorer and properties window.</LI>

<LI>
The toolbox will now dynamically realign the buttons to fit when resized.</LI>

<LI>
Update method now added to OnyxWindow. This basically informs the x-server
that the window needs to be redrawn. Other objects will soon have this
method added as well.</LI>

<LI>
When custom controls are added it is no longer necessary to explicitly
use the recompile button. The new controls will be compiled during the
next make.</LI>
</UL>
<B>October 15, 1997(v.0.1.4)</B>
<UL>
<LI>
Minor bug fix release. The project explorer in version 0.1.3 could cause
a segmentation fault. Problem fixed. Nothing major added.</LI>
</UL>
<B>October 19, 1997(v.0.1.5)</B>
<UL>
<LI>
The Make window should work better. The button release event wasn't propagating
to the scroll bar. New properties for the OnyxWindow fixed this. It also
responds to resizeing the window.</LI>

<LI>
The Properties window now responds to resizes (finally!).</LI>

<LI>
New objects are no longer named "new_ObjectType". They are now continuously
numbered with a new unique number in the format of "ObjectType#". This
will make all new objects uniquely named.</LI>

<LI>
OnyxButton now supports disabled and enabled states.</LI>

<LI>
Make will now prompt to save the project if the Makefile does not exist.
Choose "yes" to save and compile, "no" to compile without saving, and "cancel"
to abort the make.</LI>

<LI>
onyxrun sample program updated to use the button disabling.</LI>

<LI>
New sample, buttonfun. demonstrates enabling and disabling buttons as well
as using more than one form.</LI>

<LI>
Samples are now contained in directories under onyx/doc/samples instead
of just a tar file.</LI>

<LI>
Update method added to OnyxLabel, OnyxButton and OnyxCheckBox objects.</LI>

<LI>
OnyxCheckBox now generates ButtonClick events as well as ButtonPressed
and ButtonReleased.</LI>

<LI>
OnyxCheckBox now supports enabled and disabled states.</LI>

<LI>
Most toolbar buttons and menus are disabled if a project is not currently
opened.</LI>

<LI>
Stop button no longer kills onyx if the developing program has not been
run yet.</LI>

<LI>
Toolbox, Properties, and Explorer buttons now toggle the respective windows
on and off.</LI>

<LI>
Lock controls button created. Toggleing it will prevent accidently adding,
deleteing, or moving objects.</LI>
</UL>
<B>October 21, 1997(v.0.1.6)</B>
<UL>
<LI>
Minor bug fix release. The buttons/menus were not enabled when starting
a new project in v.0.1.5. Problem fixed. Nothing major added.</LI>
</UL>
<B>March 6, 1998(v.0.3.0)</B>
<UL>
<LI>
Projects can now be started in any directory and there is no longer a need
to place each project in a seperate directory. OnyX will perform its own
file/directory handling to prevent collisions.</LI>

<LI>
"Save File" menu item changed to "Save Object".</LI>

<LI>
"Save File As" menu item removed. This may evenually be replaced with "Export
Object" to allow a fast exchange of like code between projects.</LI>

<LI>
File handling majorly overhauled.&nbsp; The Save Object, Project, Project
As, now make sence and work more intuitively. The project should now be
more in sync with the programmers desires. Since all files are handled
internally changes will not affect the original files until an explicate
save is issued (regardless of any saves with an editor.).</LI>

<LI>
Files are no longer automatically created.&nbsp; With a newly created project,
a project save is necessary to write the initial files. Thus, no more surprise
files if you decide not to save the new project and want to trash it.</LI>

<LI>
Deletes and renames of object no longer take effect permanantly untill
you save the object or their parent respectively.</LI>

<LI>
Shell starter line now included in project file. File set with execution
status. So now you can start on a project just by "running" the project
file. :) It will automatically start OnyX and open the desired project.</LI>

<LI>
Update method added to the OnyxTextBox control.</LI>

<LI>
Added OnyxRadioButton to core control set.</LI>

<LI>
Onyx windows can now set the background color.</LI>

<LI>
Windows being developed will now display a grid for aligning objects.</LI>

<LI>
Snap to grid behavior now available during the design process. It is enabled
by default. Current spaceing is every five pixels.</LI>

<LI>
All object properties are checked against the properties listed in the
onyx object file (.oob) in the ObjectRepository. Any missing properties
are added with default values and all extra properties are removed. Thus,
as new properties are added to the core objects, your old objects will
be able to start useing them.</LI>

<LI>
OnyxIcon default size changed to 32 x 32. OnyX now overrides the default
directory causing an initial picture to appear. Thus, no more "Now where
did I just put that icon?"</LI>

<LI>
OnyxButton updated to reflect changes in the Xclass. The old IsSticky effect
is now entitled IsToggle. The new IsSticky effect will push the button
in and it won't let it pop up with out a Pop() command.</LI>

<LI>
Rearranged the buttons a little. Tried to put them in logical groups.</LI>

<LI>
Fixed a rather severe bug that would cause OnyX to exit when a key was
pressed in a text box during design time. (Error did not occur in applications
during run time.)</LI>

<LI>
Properties window only updates the lines that represent changed properties
instead of updateing the entire window.</LI>

<LI>
Make and Run combo is now implemented.</LI>

<LI>
Makefiles now "make all" by default.</LI>

<LI>
Import and exporting of individual objects between projects now available.</LI>

<LI>
Importing and exporting of entire projects is now possible. This allows
for easy sharing of projects between friends.</LI>

<LI>
Creat Application now available. Selecting this will cause OnyX to extract
only the necessary files from a project and place them in a .tgz file.
When unpacked the .tgz will expand into a directory the same name as the
application. It contains your application ready for a make and to be run!
(Note: Currently does not add in icons. This will have to be done by hand
untill version 0.3.1 or so.)</LI>

<LI>
Ahem, did I happen to mention that the menu editor is now available?!?
*the crowd cheers* You can now create your own menu bars with cascadeing
menus. No limit on the depth. Just place a menubar on your application,
select it, and then start up the menu editor from the tools menu.</LI>

<LI>
Drop boxes implemented.</LI>

<LI>
Horizontal and vertical scroll bars now available.</LI>

<LI>
List boxes are here.</LI>

<LI>
Toolbox now autosizes itself to the minimum size required. No extra spaces
on the sides.</LI>

<LI>
A warning will be displayed if you have compiled OnyX with a different
XClass version than it was originally designed with.</LI>

<LI>
Toolbar added to the Custom Controls window to allow easier viewing.</LI>

<LI>
Toolbar added to the Project Explorer for the exact same reason.</LI>

<LI>
Onyx Tree widget added. (Note: it is still in experimental/development
stage).</LI>

<LI>
Version control and conversion implemented.</LI>

<LI>
XClass version control active. You get a nice warning message if you compile
with a version of XClass thet OnyX isn't prepared for.</LI>

<LI>
The onyx executable and directory have been renamed to OnyX.</LI>

<LI>
Overwrite warning now given if you try to save over a pre-existing file.</LI>

<LI>
Name of main window now reflects the name of the project being worked on.</LI>

<LI>
Some object properties now have read-only or read-write drop boxes to aid
in choosing acceptable values.</LI>

<LI>
For any color property, a color selector window can be used. It is activated
by pressing the button that will appear&nbsp; next to the property text
entry.</LI>

<LI>
A file browser is now available for any ithem that requires a file name,
a directory name, or both. If both are available the updateing one will
automatically update the other as well.</LI>

<LI>
Typing new values for most properties will now be reflected in the visible
object. For example, changing x or y corrdinates will move the item. Note:
You must hit return before the change will be taken. :)</LI>

<LI>
Deleting an object no longer forces an expensive (and not to mention annoying)
window flash. The deleted object now just dissapears quietly all by itself.</LI>

<LI>
Update method added to OnyxButton. Useing it you can now jump back an forth
between text and picture buttons without destroying and recreating it.
Pictures can also be changed this way.</LI>

<LI>
Update method added to OnyxIcon.</LI>

<LI>
Properties controling window decorations and available functionality now
accessable in OnyxWindow.</LI>

<LI>
Tool tips added to OnyxButton.</LI>

<LI>
View window and next window buttons added to the main window.</LI>

<LI>
(*whew* Is that enough changes for a single release?)</LI>

Known Bugs (unfixed)</H2>
<B>Bug:</B> Under some window managers the snap to grid on the window causes
it to migrate across the screen.
<BR><B>Comments:</B> This seems to be due to the window manager making
its own adjustment ot the window position and not notifying the client.

window in odd positions but at least it doesn't migrate. Fvwm95 doesn't
seem to have this problem ;) This will be remedied hopefully in 0.3.1
