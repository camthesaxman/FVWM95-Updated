<BR><B>Question: </B>Just what the ?$*Big Fat Hairy Rooster&amp;*(#$ is
OnyX?
<BR><B>Answer:</B> It is a visual development interface for the Xclass
widget set. Other visual development examples are Visual Basic and Visual
C++ for Microshaft.

<P><B>Question:</B> What is the Xclass widget set and where do I get it?
<BR><B>Answer:</B> Its time for you to go to the&nbsp; <A HREF="http://xclass.sourceforge.net/index.html">Xclass
homepage</A>.

<P><B>Question: </B>Is OnyX an interpreter or code generator?
<BR><B>Answer:</B> Definitively a code generator.

<P><B>Question: </B>What platforms will it run on?
<BR><B>Answer:</B> If you can use the Xclass then ideally OnyX should run
also.

<P><B>Question: </B>So how much will OnyX cost?
<BR><B>Answer:</B> <A HREF="http://www.gnu.ai.mit.edu/copyleft/gpl.html">GPL.</A>
Get it? Got it? Good. End of story. :)

<P><B>Question: </B>So where did the name for OnyX come from?
<BR><B>Answer:</B> Since all of the visual objects in the Xclass set begin
with the letters "OX" I wanted to include thoses letters in the name. OnyX
is the first decent word I came up with. If you want to put an acronym to
it I suppose you could use: <B>O</B>bviously <B>n</B>ot another barel<B>y</B>
affordable, e<B>X</B>treamly overpriced, incredebly unstable, meglomaniac
style Microshaft product. ;)

<P><B>Question:</B> Is there a beta I can try?
<BR><B>Answer:</B> No. Not yet. I want to go through alpha testing yet.

<P><B>Question:</B> Ok. Then is there an alpha I can try?
<BR><B>Answer:</B> Yes there is, just mail me personally at c705751@showme.missouri.edu,
so I can have a list of who to announce new fixes/bugs to. Then check out
the <A HREF="alpha.html">alpha testing page.</A>

<P><B>Question:</B> Is there any other way I can help?
<BR><B>Answer:</B> Sure. I really need a good logo. I suck at drawing.
All logo contributions are welcome and credit will be GLADLY given to any
one whose ideas/artwork I use. As for coding, wait until I reach beta
stage. Play with the alpha first, peek at the code, and see if you want
to help. If you do, send me a message and when it goes beta, I will form
an OnyX development team.

<P><B>Question:</B> Dude, what sort of coffee do you drink?!?!
<BR><B>Answer:</B> Anything I can get as long as it is strong! Of course,
feel free to send me any gourmet coffee you just happen to have lying around.
*grin*
