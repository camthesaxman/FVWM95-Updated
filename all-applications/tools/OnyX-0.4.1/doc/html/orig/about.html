&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have been with Linux since the 1.wayback.something
releases. I have also been with Microsoft's Windows95 since it was in beta
and it liked to create two F: drive partitions. Thus, I have had a lot
of time to compare the two systems.
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One of the more exciting moments I had in Windows95
was when I discovered Microsoft's Visual Basic. Wow. Up to this point all
of my programs had been text only across a variety of platforms.&nbsp;
But now, all of a sudden, I could create windows programs also.&nbsp; It
was just way to easy. Click on a button and you get a new window. Click
on the toolbar, select a control, and place it on the form. Presto, it
works. You can compile it and send it to your friends to show how advanced
(or how ridiculous) you are. To change the tools you just modified their
properties. To make something happen you just went to the appropriate event
for that tool and coded it in. My, how sweet. Naturally I started coded
my heart out and even went so far as to make my own usenet news server
with a windows explorer interface.
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; About that time I got a new hard drive. Hmm, lets
see. What should I use it for? Linux or Windows95? Heh, that was a no brainer.
Linux here you go! Now I suddenly had room to be able to run XWindows.
Well, ok. But I didn't like the interface. I thought fvwm looked silly
and Afterstep was only so so. I didn't do much until I stumbled upon Fvwm95.
Oh, now there was something that looked familiar. (No I am NOT a Microshaft
weenie. I just like the interface.) I set up Fvwm95 and found out I had
to occasionally reboot to my Microsoft side just to see if it still worked.
I almost completely ceased to use it.
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While on the Fvwm95 page I spotted the XClass widget
set. "Hmm, this looks interesting..." I said to no one in particular. "Its
still being worked on so let's see how far they are.". I setup the XClass
and said Wow! again. (This time I said it to someone in particular. But,
since it was the plant in the window, it had a low intelligence and refuses
to understand anything not made by Microsoft. We have since parted ways.)
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now once I had the XClass up and running I decided
I would like to make something with it. I severely doubted that anything
would come of it. The reason was that I had tried XWindows programming
with other tool kits, Athena in particular, and found it to be quite a
tangled mess. Remembering what Visual Basic was like I searched the web
and tried to find something similar for X. Everything I found was sadly
not anywhere near my hopes and expectations. The two best I found were
xvisual and a motif toolkit designer. I didn't have the money for motif
(yes I do have lesst-tiff but the designer wasn't ready to handle that)
and as for xvisual well... I liked it because I could actually make stuff
but only kludgeingly so. Also, I couldn't make things look professionally
enough for my tastes.
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Where was I, oh yes, I was attempting to make something
new with the XClass set and was quite pessimistic abut it. I started by
trying to make a simple window. It took me a bit of searching through the
other examples (very few at the time) but I succeeded. Hmm, interesting,
I even understood how I did it. Ok, well then, I will add a button to my
window and make it do something. With a little more searching (not near
as much this time) I succeeded. WOW! I can really build stuff with this!
(I was quite excited and stuck my tongue out at the aforementioned plant.)
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I decided to tackle something bigger. Fvwm95 had
a spot for the "Run..." program in its menu but did not have anything for
execute for it. I decided to build it. It took a few days but I did it.
(It is now included in the standard XClass distribution.) This XClass programming
was "almost" easy. I realized there was a potential that other users, who
were like me and had trouble working with other widget sets, might be able
to start making their own programs and contribute to the flood of Linux
software. Furthermore, it looked professional.
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It was considering this that I began to remember
xvisual and Visual Basic. I realized that the XClass was well suited for
just that sort of development. I decided then and there that I wanted to
create something similar for XClass that would allow a huge number of people
to point and click their way to making lots of and hopefully quality software.
Having something like that would remove the tedium of doing some things
over and over again. Just point and click. Development of large apps would
be MUCH faster.
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thus the idea of OnyX was born. Rapid Application
Development software. I suppose the whole above story could be summed up
by the following:
<BR>Question: Why did you start building OnyX?
<BR>Answer(s): Because I want to. I enjoy it. 'cause I feel like it. Because
I hope it will help somebody else. 'cause Microshaft wont get a single
red cent. Because its Linux. And last but not least,&nbsp; Hey why not?
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My ultimate goal with OnyX is to have something
useful, worthwhile, powerful, and FREE (via GPL). How far will I go? As
far as I can bloody well get! I hope I succeed. The only way I will, however,
is if you can occasionally test OnyX to its fullest and let me know where
the problems are. Feel free to grab the most recent release from the alpha
testers page. Thanks for showing your interest by reading this. I hope
it is and will be well worth it.

Sincerely,
