OnyX is an application development environment that ressembles the old MS
Visual Basic 3.0: you have at your disposition a collection of controls that
can be added to a form in an interactive way.<p>

Unlike Visual Basic, OnyX applications are compiled into a standalone
executable and therefore ... . As a downside, no interactive debugger is
included.<p>

If you are a C programmer, you should not feel scared by the fact that
OnyX uses C++. In fact, programming in OnyX is more close to C that
it is to C++... <p>

Visual Basic-like application development environment: the user is
presented a collection of "OnyX" objects (controls or building blocks) that
can be added to a form (top-level window).<p>

Object properties, like color, name, size and position can be specified at
design time, and modified during run time. The user typically needs only to
write the code to execute in response to an action performed by the
object.<p>

OnyX does not provides a direct way of creating new types of these building
blocks. Instead, the user is limited to the standard set of objects supplied
with the distribution, and controls supplied by third parties ("custom
controls").<p>

OnyX objects are some sort of intermediate objects that control the
behaviour of xclass widgets, presenting a standarized set of properties to
the user and to the development environment.<p>

What is needed: xclass-0.9.1 or higher, ... <p>

Although it looks very simple, OnyX is very powerful and lets you to create
complex applications. As an example, the whole OnyX development environment
is written in OnyX.<p>

Blah blah... etc... <p>
