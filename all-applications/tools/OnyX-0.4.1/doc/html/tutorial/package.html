...<p>

Select "Create Application" from the File menu. This will cause OnyX to
extract only the necessary files from a project and place them in a .tgz
file. When unpacked, the .tgz will expand into a directory with the same
name as the application. It contains your application ready for make and
to be run. (Note: currently does not add icons. This will have to be done
by hand).<p>
