<H1>Onyx Tutorial</H1>

Step by step instructions to your first OnyX application.<p>

Let's make a simple "Hello world" application. Start OnyX. A splash screen
flashes for a second and then the main OnyX window appears at the top
of the screen.

<center><img src="onyxmain.gif"></center>

Select "New Project" from the File menu. In the dialog box that appears type
a name for the application, for example <b>hello</b> and click the "Start
New Project" button.<p>

A window like the one below will appear:

<center><img src="designform.gif"></center>

That is the design form for the main window. The dotted pattern is a grid
that facilitates control alignment. That grid will not appear in the
generated application.<p>

Now click on the Toolbox icon <img src="toolboxicon.gif"> in the toolbar or
select "ToolBox" from the "View" Menu to bring the ToolBox window:

<center><img src="toolbox.gif"></center>

The ToolBox shows a set of basic controls that can be placed on your main
window. That is not the complete set, and later we will show you how to add
and remove controls from the ToolBox.<p>

Let's place a label on the main window. Click on the first button on the
third row from the top <img src="toolboxlabel.gif"> to select the label
control. Then click somewhere on the design window to place the label:<p>

<center><img src="designform1.gif"></center>

Now you can click on the label and move it around. You will notice that
four small brackets appears at the edges of the area occupied by the label.

<center><img src="brackets.gif"></center>

To resize the label, click and drag one of these brackets. To move the
label, just click inside the label area and drag the label. You will notice
that when you release the mouse button, the brackets will "stick" to the
closest grid dots. That's the "snap-to-grid" feature that can be used to
neately align controls.<p>

Now click on the Properties <img src="propertiesicon.gif"> toolbar button or
select "Properties" from the "View" menu. The Properties dialog for the
current control (the label) appears, allowing you to modify its settings.<p>

<center><img src="properties.gif"></center>

Change the text displayed by the label by typing something in the the field
labeled "Text". For example, <b>Hello, world!</b>. Press Enter, then
close the window.<p>

<i>Note: You <b>must</b> press Enter after modifying any of the fields in
the Properties dialog box for the changes to take place. If you do not press
Enter on some control and close the Properties window, the changes will be
lost. That's the current way of cancelling changes. That behaviour may
change in the future, either by automatically applying the changes as you
type, or by including an "OK" and "Cancel" buttons. You can usually see the
changes reflected immediately after pressing Enter without having to close
the Properties window.</i><p>

If the label does not display the full text that you typed and it appears
cropped, that means that the label is too small and you should enlarge it.
Finally, center the label so the main window looks like the one below:

<center><img src="designform2.gif"></center>

We are now ready to build the application.<p>

Click on the "Make and Run" <img src="makerunicon.gif"> toolbar button.
Oops... a warning message box appears, we haven't saved our project yet!
Answer "Yes" to the save question, and a file dialog box will appear asking
you to select a directory where the project should be saved. If you are
happy with the current directory, just click "Open". Otherwise change to the
appropiate directory first.<p>

After the project is saved, a window appears where you can monitor the
build process. When the compilation is done, your application is started.<p>

<center><img src="helloapp.gif"></center>

No... it is <i>not</i> that the grid suddenly dissappeared. That's your
application running! <b><i>And you didn't have to type a single line of
code!</i></b> Notice that it sits right in the same place the design window
is. To convince yourself, just move it to a side to reveal the design window
behind.<p>

<i>Note: Some window managers might override the window's specified 
starting position. I've used Fvwm95 for this example, and I would expect
most other window managers to produce the same behaviour.</i><p>

Close the application by clicking on the close button in the window title
bar. You might want to exit OnyX at this point and to try running the
application manually.<p>

You would be probably asking yourself by now: "where is my program?". Let's
have a look at the OnyX project structure.<p>

In the directory where you saved your project you will find a file named
<b>hello.oxp</b>. That's the project file, it is a text file, and it has
executable permissions. If you execute it, the OnyX development environment
is called and it will automatically open the project.<p>

In the same directory you will find a hidden subdirectory named
<b>.hello.oxd</b>. Inside it you will find your <b>hello</b> executable.
There are also a bunch of other files: a Makefile, some source files (*.cc),
header files (*.h), object files (*.o) and "object collection" files
(*.oxc). All these files were automatically generated by OnyX and together
they describe your application.<p>

There is also a hidden <b>.onyx</b> subdirectory which contains the set of
OnyX objects your that application uses (more exactly, the objects that
currently appear in the ToolBox). These are just copies from the OnyX
ObjectRepository directory.<p>
