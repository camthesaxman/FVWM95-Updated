<H1>Interacting with the external world</H1>

The traditional <a href="helloworld.html">"Hello world"</a> programs are
usually boring examples, they just show a message and that's it. They don't
interact with the user, and they aren't cool.<p>

...etc...

<p>
Let's now place a push button. Click on the second button <img
src="toolboxbutton.gif"> on the top row to select the push button control.
Then click somewhere on the design window to place the button:<p>

<center><img src="designform1.gif"></center>

As with the label, you can click on the button and move it around. But this
time you will notice that the button tends to "eat" left mouse button
clicks, so you'll have to move it around using the right or the middle mouse
button. The same applies to the resize operation using the brackets.<p>

...etc...
