- Multiple file copies
- DnD
- Options dialog: refresh file view after modifying mime.types file (maybe
  OXFileList in xclass should monitor mime.types file changes?).
- Object menus/actions
- Recycle bin: must save recycledrc file after each modification to the
  recycle (file must be locked during write access), so any other explorer
  instance that opened the recycle bin could re-sync its contents [perhaps
  this should be an xclass-core object?]
